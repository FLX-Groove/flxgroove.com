Flx Groove was founded in Sept 2022 by three upstate NY DJ’s,  Brandon Carson, Aaron H, and Jason Passmore. We play House, Dance and various EDM genres. As a rule of thumb, we do not take requests. (Not that we’re above it, just because we all plan our sets very strategically and want to curate a certain vibe and aesthetic.) To continue on that note, it is important to verbalize that we encourage diversity and inclusion at all of our events. Everyone is welcome.

We typically play events in the southern tier of New York. Often in or around Corning, Elmira, or Ithaca. We have our own sound system, with capacity for just about any venue size. In addition to this, Jason is also a VJ and does projection mapping. In addition to standard DJ lighting, we also use Govee lighting at all of events.

Our crew has grown since it’s inception. We welcomed Joe Parillo in 2024 as a regular member. 2024 is the first year we started inviting guest DJ’s to perform with us. Our first event as a group was at Volo in Corning, NY. We called it House Arrest because it was during the tail end of COVID. We continue to play shows there just about monthly. In addition to that we are regulrarly featured in local festivals and Events. See our the shows tab for details,
